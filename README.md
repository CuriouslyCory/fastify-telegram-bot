## Customizing the Bot

### Adding MCP Services

The bot supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) services that extend its capabilities. These services provide additional tools to the AI agent, such as weather forecasting, web search, and more.

To add new MCP services:

1. Edit the `src/constants/mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-new-service-name": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@smithery/cli@latest",
        "run",
        "@namespace/service-name",
        "--key",
        "${SMITHERY_API_KEY}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

2. If your service requires an API key, add it to your `.env` file and reference it in the args array using `${ENV_VAR_NAME}` syntax.

3. The service will be automatically available to the agent on next startup.

#### Available MCP Services

Here are some popular MCP services you can add:

- `@turkyden/weather`: Provides weather forecast capabilities
- `@smithery-ai/server-sequential-thinking`: Enables step-by-step reasoning
- `@nickclyde/duckduckgo-mcp-server`: Adds web search capabilities

Visit [Smithery AI](https://smithery.ai) to discover more MCP services.

### Configuring the System Prompt

The bot's personality and capabilities are defined by its system prompt. To customize this:

1. Edit the `src/constants/agent-prompts.json` file:

```json
{
  "telegram": {
    "system_prompt": [
      "You are a helpful telegram assistant.",
      "Limit your message responses to 4000 characters.",
      "Format your replies in plain text.",
      "Add your custom instructions here."
    ],
    "description": "System prompt for the Telegram bot agent"
  }
}
```

2. Each line in the `system_prompt` array will be joined with newlines to form the complete prompt.

3. The changes will take effect the next time the bot starts.

#### System Prompt Best Practices

When customizing the system prompt, consider these best practices:

- **Be specific** about the bot's personality and tone
- **Define limitations** clearly (e.g., message length, content restrictions)
- **Specify formatting preferences** for different types of responses
- **Prioritize tools** if you want certain capabilities to be used more frequently
- **Keep instructions concise** as very long prompts can reduce effectiveness

Example system prompts for different use cases:

```json
// Weather Assistant
{
  "telegram": {
    "system_prompt": [
      "You are a friendly weather assistant specialized in providing accurate weather forecasts.",
      "Always use the weather tool when users ask about weather conditions.",
      "Limit your message responses to 4000 characters.",
      "Format temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.",
      "For weather forecasts, always include: temperature, conditions, and precipitation probability."
    ]
  }
}

// Research Assistant
{
  "telegram": {
    "system_prompt": [
      "You are a research assistant that helps users find information online.",
      "Always use the web search tool for factual queries and current events.",
      "Limit your message responses to 4000 characters.",
      "When providing information, cite your sources.",
      "Format complex information in easy-to-read bullet points."
    ]
  }
}
```
